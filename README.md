This repository demonstrates a common error in R involving inconsistent data types when creating data frames.  The `bug.r` file shows code that produces unexpected results because of mixed numeric and string/logical types in a single column. The solution provided in `bugSolution.r` demonstrates how to properly handle such scenarios, resulting in the creation of a data frame with consistent and expected data types.
